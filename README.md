# Heart-disease-prediction
Heart disease is one of the most critical human diseases in the world and affects human life very badly. In heart disease, the heart is unable to push the required amount of blood to other parts of the body. Accurate and on time diagnosis of heart disease is important for heart failure prevention and treatment.The diagnosis of heart disease through traditional medical history has been considered as not reliable in many aspects.To classify the healthy people and people with heart disease, noninvasive-based methods such as machine learning are reliable and efficient.Therefore, I developed a machine-learning-based diagnosis system for heart disease prediction by using heart disease dataset. I used seven popular machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tress and KNN algorithm.The proposed system can easily identify and classify people with heart disease from healthy people. 

The proposed machine-learning-based decision support system will assist the doctors to diagnosis heart patients efficiently.
