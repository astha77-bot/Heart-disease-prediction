# Heart-disease-prediction
 The diagnosis of heart disease through traditional medical history has been considered as not reliable in many aspects. To classify the healthy people and people with heart disease, noninvasive-based methods such as machine learning are reliable and efficient. In the proposed study, we developed a machine-learning-based diagnosis system for heart disease prediction by using heart disease dataset. We used seven popular machine learning algorithms,
